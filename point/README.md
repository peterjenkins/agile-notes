# Point

A story point is a unit of measurement that describes relative complexity.

1 is the smallest unit of work. Resource swap.

2 mostly understood finite task

3 bigger chunk of work

5 is next up from 3, which forces you to go up to a 5 or accept the complexity and go down to the 3

8 one person's time, during a whole sprint

13 too big to fit in the sprint
