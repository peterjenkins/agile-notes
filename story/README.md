# Story

## Description

As a developer...

...I want the software not to crash on start up...

...so that I can get something done.

## Acceptance criteria

Running the app results in the log in screen being shown.

## Size

The amount of information reflected in a user story is small.

To estimate the level of detail, think about what you could fit on two three by five cards, *in permanent marker*.

Each section, the description of the story and the acceptance criteria, should be able to fit on an index card.
