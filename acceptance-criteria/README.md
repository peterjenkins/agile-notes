# Acceptance criteria

Your user stories should have acceptance criteria. The acceptance criteria says, "if these statements are true, the ticket is done".

## Using fewer words produces more clarity

For maximum effectiveness, the acceptance criteria needs to be kept very succinct.

They should contain no more information than can be written on a single 3x5 index card, *using a permanent marker*.

This may seem to you to be an unrealistic expectation. It's not. It just requires you to shift your mindset.

If you can't possibly find a way to fit all your acceptance criteria onto an index card, this doesn't indicate the card is **too small**. Instead, it indicates that the user story is **too big**.

You'll want to *break down* your user story into smaller and simpler cases.

For example, many products behave differently, depending on whether or not the user has authenticated themselves.

These cases should be considered in separate user stories. One user story for anonymous, another for logged in users.

User stories should also fit onto a single 3x5 card in marker. **Two index cards total represents the entire story.**

## Why bother?

For both the product owner and the dev team, it is far **easier** and more **cost-effective** to identify and fix a problem with the *requirements*, rather than a problem with the *product*.

Clear and concise acceptance criteria helps you do so **before the software is developed**, rather than after.

Otherwise developers end up wasting their time, and the result doesn't meet the needs of the product owner either. In addition, it's much easier to **build something right the first time**. Unclear requirements can lead to a need to a change a complex, interconnected software system that already exists. This is far less efficient than **tearing up some index cards and starting fresh.**

Consider the case where the product owner has done a good job, and the description of some work can fit onto two 3x5 cards, written with a permanent marker. The chance of serious miscommunication is fairly low. Partly because there's no room to repeat yourself, and the medium forces you to be clear and concise.

Acceptance criteria are very helpful to the developer, once he starts working on the ticket. He can accurately measure his progress through the task, and they can help get him back on track if he's fallen down a rabbit hole.

When a task is described by multiple paragraphs of text, by tables, or by long lists of bullet points, it's easy to accidentally leave out some aspects of the requirements.

Two index cards (written in marker, not pen) is about the amount of information a developer can fit **in his head** at one time. This means he can be confident that he's completed the work correctly, and in its entirety. When he knows the story is actually done, he can push it on to the next stage in the process and empty it out of his **mental RAM**.

This allows him to leave it behind him immediately, like a pair of old shoes, and move on to a fresh new story with a clear head.
