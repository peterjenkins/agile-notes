Recommendation is to visit the space ahead of time and practice hooking up. Plan for contingencies.

## Recording

Producing a backup recording is highly recommended. This allows you to fall back and still provide a meaningful demo.

## Scribe

You can designate a person to write down the feedback so that it doesn't get lost.

## Explain
