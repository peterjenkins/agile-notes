# Sprint

A sprint represents a measurable chunk of work. It should be immutable, barring unforeseen circumstances. A typical sprint length is two weeks.

The idea of a sprint is to *decide* all of the work you're going to do, before you start doing it. That way you don't constantly have to stop what you're doing and wonder what you should be doing. You decide what you should be doing for two weeks, and then you have *two weeks of actionable work* ready to do.

The sprint reflects a certain amount of work, and all that work should be ready for dev.

The product owner reviews the work and make sure it reflects current priorities.

## Backlog

The backlog is an ordered arrangement of tickets. The tickets at the top are the most important ones.

The product owner arranges the backlog so that the top of the backlog reflects the most important work to be completed.

## Refinement

The dev team and product owner discuss proposed work for the upcoming sprint in a backlog refinement meeting.

Questions will arise about the way the product is meant to behave. There's still time for the product owner to update the tickets to reflect more specific details.

## Measuring

You can use a burn down chart to understand the relationship between time remaining in the sprint and the amount of work outstanding.

It gives you a visual indication of scope creep or items that get tossed backwards in the process. What that looks like is left as an exercise to the reader.
