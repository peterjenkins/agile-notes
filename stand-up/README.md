# Stand up

## Purpose
Primary purpose is to allow the dev team to sync up about what they are working on. Identify blockers.

## Timing
Every day at the same time. Use what works for your team. Book for 10 minutes.

## Space
Consider an open area near the dev team. You want people to be able to go back to what they were working on, quickly.

## Roster
Dev team. May also include product owner, other stakeholders, depending on your situation.

### Sidebar: Chickens

The original analogy was chickens and pigs. The chicken part stuck more.

The idea is that in a group of people, some of them are chickens. The chickens don't have a primary voice in the conversation.

It's critical for the dev team to sync up as they get their day started. They may be working on similar parts of functionality and need to know what parts not to touch. There may be dependencies between parts of the work that need to be coordinated.

Keeping the conversation between the dev team members keeps focus on what's immediately most relevant.

## Corollary: Only the dev team can speak

If you didn't do any **actual work** on the sprint since the previous scrum, you don't have a voice at the table. Just say "I don't have anything". Don't discuss projects that you worked on which are outside the scope of the meeting.

Discussing outside projects adds meaningless noise to the voices of the actual development team. It adds friction and slows communication. It's also really distracting.

Keep in mind that each member of your development team is thinking about **their work** for the day. They may have already started a task, which is being interrupted by scrum. And they may have some complex thinking in-progress, which requires their focus.

If you inject extra information, this forces them to interrupt their thinking to consider the items you are bringing up.

And if those items you are bringing up are completely irrelevant to the team, you're getting in the way of them doing their jobs. It's disrespectful.

The purpose of scrum is so they can factor in the work that's being done by other members of the team. If there's a finish-to-start dependency between two tasks, the two developers working on those tasks needs to communicate that fact with each other. It's to help people be on the same page and avoid stepping on someone elses toes inadvertently. It's also to avoid a nasty merge conflict that can happen if two people touch the same area of the product at once.

If you aren't actively working on the same goals as the rest of the team, adding your *status* just takes away from the meaningful discussions that need to be taking place.

The daily stand-up meeting is **not a status meeting**. It is for the development team. If others outside the team benefit from knowing what work is in flight, fair enough. But the meeting needs to be driven entirely to meet the needs of the team.

And the development team members should address each other, directly.

Remember, there's no need for stakeholders to ask how things are going. This is part of the covenant of agile. The work has already been decided for the duration of the sprint. It's up to the team how they work together to get the job done.

If you discuss projects that are not related to this agile team, you distract the team. This prevents the rest of development team from getting back to work. Despite the fact that what you are saying does not affect their ability to do their jobs.

## Friction creates measurable problems

It's possible to respond to the points above and say "it's no big deal". "Does it really matter if someone spouts off about the thing they worked on yesterday, which is unrelated to the team and the sprint?"

The answer is *yes*. In order for your team members to feel respected, and for them to function effectively, all barriers, distractions and annoyances need to be reduced to the bare minimum possible. If you force people to participate in an agile process that gets in the way of their jobs, you will produce resentment.

Any friction has a significant, measurable impact on the team's velocity. Get out of the way and **put the team in charge** of the process.

## Format

Each member of the dev team talks once. It's good to go in a circle so each person can anticipate their turn to speak and mentally prepare themselves.

Each person should describe the following items:

 - What he worked on yesterday
 - What he's going to work on today
 - Any blockers that are currently preventing him from doing his work

## Preparation

Recommendation is to prepare ahead of time what you're going to say. Review email, calendar, ticket system, source control management system.

Reviewing the *hard landscape* of what's already on your calendar may influence your expectations for what you can realistically get done.

If there are items that require someone else's action, you may want to reach out to them before scrum so they can plan their day better.

## Goal

There's another reason for keeping the focus, and the speaking, on just the dev team. Individuals are presenting their status, but status is not the purpose of the meeting.

Repeat: **This is not a meeting for stakeholders to check up on how things are going**. The purpose of this meeting is for the dev team to coordinate with each other.

Members of the dev team are likely to direct their speaking towards a single individual. This should be discouraged. Instead, address your peers.

Scrum is meant to be a fast sync up. If everyone's tasks are piecewise orthogonal, there's no need to get into details.
