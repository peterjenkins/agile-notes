# Stand up

## Purpose
Primary purpose is to allow the dev team to sync up about what they are working on. Identify blockers.

## Timing
Every day at the same time. Use what works for your team. Book for 10 minutes.

## Space
Consider an open area near the dev team. You want people to be able to go back to what they were working on, quickly.

## Roster
Dev team. May also include product owner, other stakeholders, depending on your situation.

### Sidebar: Chickens

The original analogy was chickens and pigs. The chicken part stuck more.

The idea is that in a group of people, some of them are chickens. The chickens don't have a primary voice in the conversation.

It's critical for the dev team to sync up as they get their day started. They may be working on similar parts of functionality and need to know what parts not to touch. There may be dependencies between parts of the work that need to be coordinated.

Keeping the conversation between the dev team members keeps focus on what's immediately most relevant.

## Format

Each member of the dev team talks once. It's good to go in a circle so each person can anticipate their turn to speak and mentally prepare themselves.

Each person should describe the following items:

 - What he worked on yesterday
 - What he's going to work on today
 - Any blockers that are currently preventing him from doing his work

## Preparation

Recommendation is to prepare ahead of time what you're going to say. Review email, calendar, ticket system, source control management system.

Reviewing the *hard landscape* of what's already on your calendar may influence your expectations for what you can realistically get done.

If there are items that require someone else's action, you may want to reach out to them before scrum so they can plan their day better.

## Goal

There's another reason for keeping the focus, and the speaking, on just the dev team. Individuals are presenting their status, but status is not the purpose of the meeting.

Repeat: **This is not a meeting for stakeholders to check up on how things are going**. The purpose of this meeting is for the dev team to coordinate with each other.

Members of the dev team are likely to direct their speaking towards a single individual. This should be discouraged. Instead, address your peers.

Scrum is meant to be a fast sync up. If everyone's tasks are piecewise orthogonal, there's no need to get into details.
