# Retrospective

The purpose of the retrospective meeting is for the development team to sync up and find out how they are working with each other.

\+ Positives - These are things we did well.

The idea is that by explicitly paying attention to the things that we did well, we focus, to help ensure **things stay that way**.

Δ Deltas - There are always going to be things we didn’t do as well. Deltas represent changes we would like to happen. In the next sprint, it would be better if we did *this*.

Here is an example that was discussed and resolved:

Δ “It would be better if the Test Engineering tickets were not in the In Dev column”

Deltas from one sprint can become positives in the next sprint:

\+ “We progressed the Test Engineering tickets out of the In Dev column at the beginning of the sprint and that was a great help because I was able to find the information I needed quickly.”

It's ok to bring things up even if you don't have a proposed solution--someone else might have an idea.
