# Refinement

Backlog refinement is the process of reviewing and discussing user stories. The user stories have been written by the product owner.

For each user story, the product owner provides a brief summary of what the ticket is, and what needs to be done.

The development team then asks questions, to unearth uncertainty and nail down the acceptance criteria and story description.

If there are issues with the story that can't be immediately addressed, the ticket should be moved to a lower position in the backlog. (In many cases, the bottom of the backlog is a suitable destination for these types of stories.)

Once the product owner has updated the story to be clear and unambiguous and ready for development, the product owner will move the ticket near the top of the backlog.

At this point, the team should have another opportunity to refine the ticket before being asked to take that ticket into a sprint.

Once all the kinks of a ticket have been worked out, and the development team understands the scope of it, the ticket needs to be given a score.

## Scoring

Scoring a ticket is done in story points, and represents the *relative difficulty* of the work.
