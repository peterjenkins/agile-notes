# scrum-master

The scrum master is the main contact point between the development team and **everyone else**.

His job is to keep everyone else out of the way so that the development team can do their job: creating a software product.

If a ticket is blocked in any way, such that it is not ready for development, the ticket should be moved to a blocked status and assigned to the scrum master.

The scrum master has the job of talking to people outside the development team, as necessary, to unblock the user story.

Sometimes a user story can not be unblocked because it is waiting for something to be done, by someone outside the development team. If the scrum master determines that a ticket can't be unblocked quickly, he should remove the ticket from the active sprint.

The development team can only commit to completing work that is well-understood and for which no blockers are present.

### Sidebar: stories versus tickets

As noted elsewhere, these two words are not interchangable, but will be treated as if they are interchangable
