# Execution

There's multiple ways a retrospective can be run. This document intends to document best practices at the level of concrete actions. It also describes the reasons why those actions are effective.

It's no fun to be told to do something without an explanation for why it matters.

The process outlined in this document is intentionally prescriptive and detailed. This details contained here largely reflect best practices learned through experience.

## Follow rote, to start

It's recommended to start by following this process closely, as described. As your team members form stronger bonds with each other, and figure out what works and what doesn't, you can change the process as needed.

When learning to cook, you start by following a recipe as closely as possible. Exactly half a cup of sugar, leveled off with the back of a knife.

As your confidence and experience grows, you learn when you can replace eggs with applesauce, or when you only want half the salt indicated in the recipe.

Similarly, there is value to following a time-tested recipe for the retrospective process. This frees your team to focus on specific challenges and needs they are currently facing.

Following someone else's guide also avoids the need for debate and team concensus regarding each aspect of the process. That debate and concensus for changes will still happen.

However, it will happen *after* you have successfully navigated the challenge of putting a new process in place. By that point, your team will be more confident, and accidental complexity is less likely to be introduced.

## Timing

Recommended scheduling is after the demo and before the start of the next sprint. This time period can result in a low pressure zone that encourages everyone to unwind for a moment and take time to reflect.

The retrospective often occurs immediately following the demo. If it was done beforehand, you're unlikely to capture the full attention of the team.

It's recommended not to allow a weekend to interject itself between the demo and the retrospective. (e.g. Scheduling the demo for Friday and the retrospective for Monday.)

If you are going to invest the time in a retrospective, (which you should), you want to do it when everything is fresh.

## Space

The retrospective should be held in a room with a closed door. It's recommended to reserve the room for extra time, beyond what you think you will need.

That way you lower the risk of getting kicked out right when everyone has gotten into a solid groove. You don't want to cut a conversation short, especially if you might have been on the verge of a solution.

A room with lots of windows and natural light is desirable, to help prevent the team from feeling boxed in.

## Roster

The retrospective should consist of the human beings that are doing the actual work. The form of that *actual work* can vary between teams.

Typically *work* means one of a few things:

 - Writing code, using a source control management system
 - Testing the executable output of the source code, to ensure that it behaves the way it is supposed to behave

Some teams may also include an additional type of work:

 - Designing and creating resources in the form of png images or other assets

Describing the *intended future behavior* of the product is **not** considered part of the work completed during the sprint by the dev team.

If an individual has not been involved in **the actual work** that was done during the time period of the sprint, their voice should not be part of the retrospective.

A smaller audience helps ensure the team feels free to voice their opinions openly. This increases the likelyhood that the retrospective meeting is a highly effective use of the team's time.

In some cases it may be highly valuable for those who write code to have their own private meeting, before the retrospective with the full dev team.

## Preparation

An agenda should be included in the meeting invite. This can be incorporated by reference to a central wiki or other repository of intellectual capital.

The team is encouraged to reflect back over soon-to-be-completed sprint ahead of time. It's not expected that team members will actually bring previously prepared lists for discussion.

Simply blocking out a few minutes to look back at the sprint helps the rest of the process be more effective through the psychological effect known as *priming*.

## Example schedule

This is only an example. Detailed descriptions of these activities can be found below.

 - Capture talking points (5 minutes)
 - Alternate positives and deltas (20 to 40 minutes)
 - Agree on next actions (10 to 20 minutes)

## Capture

Materials needed: Plenty of post it notes and standard point permanent markers

Post its and markers should be available liberally and distributed to each member of the team.

Set a timer for approximately five minutes.

The expectation is that each individual will come up with three positives and three deltas. (Each written on a separate post it note.) The post it notes are private for each individual. No one should be compelled to share their notes-to-self visually with the rest of the group. They are strictly for that individual to use as a *talking point* during the remainder of the meeting.

It's possible that the team will have difficulty coming up with positives, especially if times seem bleak. However, that means that it's even more important for everyone to think of at least one thing that was done well.

Giving our attention to the positives helps recognize aspects of the process that are functioning as expected. It makes it less likely those aspects will be changed inadvertently.

Another benefit is that it helps the whole team operate on the same page. No one wants to be disenfranchised, and it's important for even the quietest members of the team to feel that they can speak freely.

Any given individual can be occasionally forgiven if, for example, they are unable to come up with any positives. However, these cases **should be the exception rather than the rule**.

**In order for this process to work, it's critical that each individual is engaged and makes a bona fide effort to contribute.**

### Sidebar: Why does it matter that everyone on the dev team takes part in the process?

The results of the retrospective process should be a list of items that *should not be changed* and a list of items that *should be changed*.

Everyone brings a unique perspective on how things have been working, and how they have not been working.

**Contributing improves the agile experience for everyone**. You may think you're the only one that feels a certain way, but it can be very refreshing and validating when someone else describes the same problem you've been facing. Even better, they may have ideas for a solution.

Team members who repeatedly fail to contribute to the retrospective process are not pulling their weight. Complaining is work, and so is recognizing what was done well.

If your team is fundamentally dysfunctional, the retrospective process will very quickly bring those failings into the light. It will take time for everyone to learn to communicate how they feel, and it's critical to *be patient and stick through the process*. Note that being patient is not the same as being complacent. If issues occur, they should be dealt with promptly. It's unreasonable to expect a disenfranchised team to commit to a process when they have no faith in it.

For that reason, it's critical to make sure everyone understands *the purpose* of the process, and is not simply going through the motions.

As your team gets used to working with each other and dedicates time and energy to the retrospective meetings, the *mechanics* (as described here) will require less conscious thought. Instead, the process takes a back seat to the **topics at hand**.

## Tracer bullets

Agile abandons the traditional model of ready, aim, fire. Which often becomes ready, aim, aim, aim, aim...

Instead, agile should function like *tracer bullets*. The idea is that special bullets, which produce a pyrotechnic trail, are included in the ammo belt, among regular bullets.

When firing, it's possible to visually ascertain whether or not the bullets are hitting their mark. If not, the weapon can be adjusted left or right, up or down as necessary. The result of that adjustment can be seen instantly in the changes to the illuminated trail.

** *Ready, aim, fire* becomes *Ready, fire, aim.* **

An agile team will block out significantly less time for long and medium range advance planning. Because of this reality, it is especially critical to adjust continuously.

Or else the team will not be focused on the appropriate targets, and results will suffer.

(Hat tip to the pragmatic programmer for the tracer bullet concept as applied to software.)

## Alternate Positives and Deltas

Once everyone has written down their positives and deltas, there are several schools of thought for how to proceed.

The strongly recommended pattern is to circle the room repeatedly. Direction can be clockwise or counter clockwise. It's not terribly important who starts, but once you've chosen a person and a direction, it's valuable to stick with it for at least that round.

One *round* results in each participant sharing one item from his list. It's a good idea to start with a round of positives.

Sometimes a team member will be on a roll. For example, a chain of interconnected topics. Once you get comfortable with this process, you can loosen up and allow them to continue speaking their mind. That's fine to do, as long as it is being done on purpose, and other team members don't get left out from participating. It's also important to **prevent the meeting getting cut short**, before everyone can say their piece.

In the beginning, it's recommended to stick to one item per person, per round. When someone has the floor, others should try to avoid interrupting. (Nods and grunts of agreement are always encouraged.)

Alternating rounds of positives and rounds of deltas helps avoid the conversation getting sucked into a vat of negativity. **It's also nice to know that you will have a chance to talk again.** That way you can focus on having exactly *one* solid thing to say, and not have to worry about saying everything at once.

Each time it's your turn to speak, pick the most salient item from those that you've written down, or perhaps one that just occurred to you, and share it with the group.

It's recommended to have a scribe to record the topics of discussion, for later reference. However, individuals may prefer to speak off the record. Those desires should be respected.

Again, side conversations about the items being discussed are natural and are fine as long as they don't interfere. As your team gets to know each other, you'll naturally tune the retrospective process *as part of the retrospective process*.

Talking points about the retrospective itself are encouraged, whether on the topic of the current retrospective, the previous retrospective, or future retrospective planning.

## Anti-patterns

### Skip the silent people.

If members of your group or shy or don't like to speak their mind, it's even more important that they speak up during the retrospective. Especially because they may not speak up in other situations.

It's worthwhile to dedicate some time to tuning the environment and process to help shy or quiet individuals feel comfortable speaking their minds.

### One chance

This anti-pattern involves one turn around the room, with each person saying all of their deltas items at once. This can cause an uncomfortable cadence.

In addition, the quality of the issues raised by any given individual is likely to be lower. This is due to the fact that each of your topics may be unrelated.

It can feel jarring and frenetic to shift suddenly between topics. In contrast, rotating the room with a comfortable cadence allows each individual a chance to build upon what others have said, or steer the conversation in a different direction.

### Big brother

In this anti-pattern, the room is filled not only with the individuals who do the sprint *work* (as described above), but also the product owners, upper management, or other stakeholders.

This environment restricts communication among the development team. The aforementioned individuals may be the very topic of a discussion that needs to take place, in order for the team to function properly.

Having a large *audience* further discourages meek or disgruntled individuals from speaking their mind. This means the team doesn't hear the feedback that it needs to hear, and the results are not pretty.

### Complainer falls silent

Sometimes someone who has frequently complained will suddenly stop. The incorrect response is to assume that the problem went away.

More likely, the individual has grown weary of a lack of results. They may feel they have been ridiculed for their ideas or complaints. They may feel their opinions are unwanted.

**This is a dangerous situation**. It's critical to reach out privately to the individual and try to connect with them. They should be supported, and actual real *action* should be taken to alleviate their complaints.

## Next actions

At the end of the meeting, there should be specific time blocked out to determine what we can do about the topics discussed.

Venting is great, and sometimes getting the team on the same page is all that's necessary. Sometimes, action needs to be taken to alleviate a concern, or to ensure positive results continue.

A good goal is for the team to agree on **three** specific *next actions*.

These items should be recorded in an appropriate manner, and should include answers to the following questions:

 - *What* will be done?
 - *Who* is going to do it?
 - *When* will it be complete?

This step of the process is not optional. There's an inherent risk involved with discussing the 800 pound gorillas that may be lurking in your team's interactions.

Another anti-pattern is to discuss a variety of issues, but then never come to a team agreement about any of them. Or to agree on actions, but fail to record who will do them, and when.

Or the actions are agreed upon but then forgotten.

If items are being raised repeatedly, and nothing is getting done, your team will inevitably become cynical and disinterested in participating in the retrospective process.

## Good luck

The agile process and methodology and mechanics can be daunting. It's critical to apply these principles and practices with sensitivity and respect for all individuals.

The process itself may be an unwelcome imposition. For best chance of success, overcommunicate. Ensure that everyone understands why you are doing this.

Realize that as a coordinator of institutional change, you are *in sales*. You need to win hearts and minds, and convince people that this will improve their day-to-day working lives.

When a team really understands the mechanics of *how* the agile process works, and *why*, and how this will *make their job better*, the results speak for themselves.
